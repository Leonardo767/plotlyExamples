# plotlyExamples


The following file attempts to visualize how the output layer of a convolutional neural network block can change according to hyperparameters of the convolution matrices.

These hyperparameters can be, but are not limited to:
* stride
* filter size
* padding

This change can be represented as a ratio: (Output image size)/(Input image size).

I use this formulaic relationship as an example to practice the Plotly data visualization tool.
